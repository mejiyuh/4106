# **Multi-Layer Perceptron for CIFAR-10 and Housing Price Prediction**

**Abstract:** This project implements Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models using PyTorch for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset and regression on housing prices. We investigate the impact of network complexity, regularization, and feature encoding on model performance. Experimental results indicate that increased complexity affects generalization, and applying dropout and L2 regularization improves stability. 

**Results:** MLPs demonstrated sensitivity to overfitting, highlighting the importance of regularization. Regularization techniques improved validation performance, but diminishing returns were observed with excessive model complexity.

**Future Research and Optimization:** Future work could explore normalization strategies, adaptive learning rate techniques, and fine-tuning dropout rates and layer configurations. Batch normalization and alternative activation functions such as Leaky ReLU and Swish could also enhance model generalization.

**Notes:** Uses CIFAR-10 for classification and a real estate dataset for regression.
